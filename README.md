# Tidy Tuesday

This repository contains the training scripts on my TidyTuesday Learning series. You will find inside the correspondent folders the codes and graphs produced. I got inspiration from various Data Viz enthusiasts which are added in the beginning of each script. This is my first version control and graph series production.

The weekly data is loaded from [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) repository.
